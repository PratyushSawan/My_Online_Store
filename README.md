### Steps for cloing this site Locally

* Clone this Repo in Your Local Machine
* After Cloning You got all the source coad of this site
* Now you have to install a local server in your machine
I usually prefer [Xampp](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) server, You can also use any other.
* After installing Xampp Copy the clonned folder named "My_Online_Store" into C:/Xampp/htdocs
It is a root directory for Xampp server if you are using other server then paste the folder on its root dirctory
* Now make a DataBase called "store" using phpmyadmin
* Import the store.sql file from Database directory in the cloned folder
* After all these thing you can check your store by serching localhost/My_Online_Store

#### You can add some function in this coad and send me a pull request for adding that to in my coad-base.
